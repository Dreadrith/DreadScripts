(v3.3.1)
--------
- [Critical Fix] Fixed Unity crashing when any 'Quick Input' window gets opened, such as Parameter Rename, Animator Selection, New Category Tag, and Quick Toggle.
- [Fix] Fixed CE defaulting to "Verify On Display" instead of "Verify On Project Load", making it not patch unless opened.

- [Known Issue] Some node styles may not apply completely correctly when patching.
- [Known Issue] Some controller templates used may include clips that are in Packages. These clips normally don't get included in packages being exported.

They may throw an error rarely but should be relatively safe.
