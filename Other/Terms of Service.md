# Terms of Service
By purchasing a product, you agree to the Terms of Service & [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/Dreadrith/DreadScripts/blob/main/Other/Privacy%20Policy.md).<br>
**Violation of these terms will result in [blacklisting](https://github.com/Dreadrith/DreadScripts/blob/main/Other/Terms%of%Service.md#blacklist)**.

## Store Rules
1. If purchasing for someone else, put the giftee's information and give them the license key (if any) for them to activate the product.
2. Refunds are viable for [licensed products](https://github.com/Dreadrith/DreadScripts/blob/main/Other/Terms%of%Service.md#license-protected-product) if it has not yet been activated. No refunds otherwise due to the nature of digital products.
3. Do **NOT** [chargeback](https://github.com/Dreadrith/DreadScripts/blob/main/Other/Terms%of%Service.md#tools).
4. For any questions/issues, read [here](https://github.com/Dreadrith/DreadScripts/blob/main/Other/Terms%of%Service.md#contact).

## Product rules:
1. Do **NOT** attempt to disassemble or de-obfuscate any script or source code, according to DMCA Code 1201 regarding circumvention of copyright protection systems.
2. Do **NOT** use HWID Spoofers when using [licensed products](https://github.com/Dreadrith/DreadScripts/blob/main/Other/Terms%of%Service.md#license-protected-product). This wouldn't be a violation in of itself but it may cause you issues with license verification and transfer guidelines.
3. Do **NOT** redistribute any file without permission or appropriate license. Follow export instructions if provided.
4. Do **NOT** claim or resell as your own.
5. The following rules apply to **ALL** products except '[Tools](https://github.com/Dreadrith/DreadScripts/blob/main/Other/Terms%of%Service.md#tools)':
    - Do **NOT** use commercially without permission or an appropriate license, such as selling on an avatar or offering the product as a service or upsell in an upload or commission.
    - Do **NOT** sell on an avatar usually costing below $10.
    - Do **NOT** use on public releases or uploads without permission.
    - Credit **@Dreadrith#3238** and provide a link to my [Store](https://dreadrith.gumroad.com/).

## Other Rules
**I reserve the right to refuse/refund and ban/blacklist users without appeal. Reasons for such may include but are not limited to:**
1. Affiliation with leaking/ripping/theft.
2. Affiliation with malicious parties.
3. Suspicious activity or account history/age/mutuals.
4. Demonstrating or promoting toxic behavior.

## My Part
1. Products will be updated and supported for as long as possible, but I am not liable for any changes made by Unity or VRChat that deprecate any features or functionality via software/game updates.
2. I am not liable for damage or harm caused by manipulation or misuse of the script.
3. If I quit, license protection systems will be removed from relevant products.

## License Transfer Guidelines
In the event of hardware change, you may request a license transfer [by contacting me](https://github.com/Dreadrith/DreadScripts/blob/main/Other/Terms%of%Service.md#contact). License transfers will follow these guidelines:
1. License transfer is only allowed after 30 days from license activation.
2. License transfer to another user is not allowed.
3. License transfer to a device from which you've already transferred from, is not allowed.

# Definitions
## License Protected Product
License producted products are scripts that require activation using a license key. License keys are acquired after purchase and can be found in the Gumroad library content view or the receipt e-mail.
## Tools
Tools are scripts that are typically used for simplifying and/or speeding up workflow, such as Avatar Dynamics Overhaul, rather than adding whole new features such as Carbon Copy. In most cases, the product's type will be listed on the product's information.
## Blacklist
Users that have been blacklisted will have product and server access revoked. Any active licenses/subscriptions and services terminated without refund. In severe cases, legal action may be taken.
## Chargeback
Chargeback is attempting to get a refund for a purchase without or against my discretion.
