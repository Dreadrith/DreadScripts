Texture Auto-Packer is made to negate the need to have to go through texture packing by automatically detecting channels modifications and update the resulting texture

How Auto-Packer works:
----------------------
Auto-Packer will usually initiate whenever a Texture gets imported, whether it's new, modified or re-imported.
It checks the settings in the Auto-Packer window, and checks for changes in each module, and packs each texture that's marked as modified.

An Auto-Packed Texture is marked as modified when:
	- The Channel Textures doesn't match the hash of the textures the last time it got packed.
	- The Channel selector was changed
	- Invert toggle was clicked.

Module Settings:
----------------
Used to determine what Auto-Packed Textures to check for channel modification
Found under Assets > Create > DreadScripts > Auto-Packer Module

An Auto-Packed Texture consists of 4 Channel Textures (RGBA) and a Packed Texture (Result)

Add:		Creates a new Auto-Packed Texture
Save As:	Determines the extension of the Packed Texture.
Quality:	Only for JPG, determines the quality of the Packed Texture.

RGBA: Determines which channel should be sampled for the respective color
Invert: Inverts the sampled colors from the color texture.

Force Pack: Packs the resulting texture regardless of modification. (Overwrites result texture).

Window Settings
---------------
Used to modify the settings of the Auto-Packer.
Found under DreadTools > Utilities > Texture Auto-Packer

Active:			Determines whether the Auto-Packer should check for channel modifications and pack the result if needed.
Active Modules:	The Modules that the Auto-Packer should lookup for textures to pack

Force Check:	Initiates the Auto-Packer without having to trigger a texture import.
